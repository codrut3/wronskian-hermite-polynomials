# Wronskian Hermite Polynomials

This repository contains several Sage scripts that accompany the paper
"The irreducibility of some Wronskian Hermite polynomials".

We used the scripts to carry out the computer searches mentioned in the
paper. Rerun the code to verify the validity of the claims in the article.

## How to run the code

1. Download and install SageMath following the instructions at
   http://sagemath.org/download.html.
1. Run `sage <script_path>` on each script to determine partitions with
   reducible remainder polynomial.
   * Note that running a script can take more than a day.
   * The comments at the top of the file describe the search space of the code.
